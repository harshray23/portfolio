    introduction: "Hi, I'm Harsh Ray. I'm a second-year student specializing in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. With a curious mind and a drive to keep learning, I’ve been honing my skills in Python, C, Java, Firebase, and MySQL — turning classroom concepts into hands-on projects. I’m passionate about building smart, efficient, and user-friendly tech solutions that not only work great but feel great to use. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing cricket or football, swimming, vibing to music, or exploring new places on tour. These experiences fuel my creativity and keep me inspired.",

      title: "AI-Powered Code Reviewer",
      description: "A tool that uses large language models to automatically review pull requests on GitHub. It checks for common errors, suggests improvements for code style and logic, and helps enforce repository-specific guidelines. This project aims to streamline the development workflow, reduce the time developers spend on manual code reviews, and improve overall code quality by catching potential issues before they are merged into the main branch. The system is built with a microservices architecture, utilizing Python for the AI backend and a React-based frontend for the dashboard.",
